YouBit allows you to host any type of file on YouTube.

It does this by creating a video where every pixel represents one or more bits of the original file. When downloaded from YouTube, this video can be decoded back into the original file.

This is not a novel idea and has been explored by other projects such as [YouTubeDrive](https://github.com/dzhang314/YouTubeDrive) and [fvid](https://github.com/AlfredoSequeida/fvid). However, these projects left alot of good ideas unexplored providing suboptimal results.

## Core Ideas
///YouTube will still allocate the exact
same bitrate to a video like this, but since it is simply longer, more total
bandwith is available. Since a completely black frame is extremely easy to compress,
this in effect gives us a higher bitrate for the frames that actually hold data.///
